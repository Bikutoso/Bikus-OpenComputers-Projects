NAME
  libBatt - library to inreact with batteries

FUNCTIONS
  list()
    Returns a list of all batteries.

  address()
    Return the current default battery.

  refresh()
    Rebuilds list of all batteries and sets a default battery (unless setPrimary is set).

  convert(type)
    Type (RF/EU) set the default power unit to show in other fucntions.

  getUnit(address)
    Returns the power type of the selected battery or default battery if no address is selected.

  setPrimary(address)
    Overrides the default battery type the selected one or clear battery if no address is selected.
    NOTE: clearing won't update the default selected battery untill next refresh.

  getEnergyStored(address, side)
    Returns the current value of the battery, if a convert value is set then it's converted to that type.
    If no address is slected it uses the default battery.
    Unsure what side does other than being RF related, it's safe to ignore this value.

  getEnergyMaxStored(address, side)
    Returns the maximum value of the battery, if a convert value is set then it's convert to that type.
    If no address is selected it uses the default battery.

  getSinkTier(address)
   Returns the IC2 sink tier, if a RF based battery 0 will be returned.
   If no address is selected is unless the default battery.

EXAMPLE
  Display power and capacity from a IC2 battery in RF based units
    batt = require("libBatt")
    
    batt.convert("RF")

    currentPower = batt.getEnergyStored()
    maxPower = batt.getEnergyMaxStored()
    unit = batt.getUnit()

    print(currentPower..maxPower.." "..unit

  Set the default battery and show current power
    batt = require("libBatt")
    
    batt.setPrimary("ce821283-ba35-4401-8bb5-ff53d51e043a")
    print(batt.getEnergyStored()

  Get the power of a battery without setting default battery
    batt = require("libBatt")

    print(batt.getEnergyStored("ce821283-ba35-4401-8bb5-ff53d51e043a")
